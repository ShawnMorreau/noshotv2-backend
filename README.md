I went through a lot of https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/ (https://github.com/ShawnMorreau/tddGolang) and picked up on TDD and creating testable code. The initial https://github.com/ShawnMorreau/no-shot-backend was hacked together for the most part, with code that wasn't very testable. It was a small achievement because I had never used websockets before and I was able to get a server up and running that allowed me to play the game with friends with the odd bug here and there. This is a more methodical approach to creating the backend for my game No Shot! I am trying my best to stick to TDD to ensure I'm testing my code. I am also creating all of the game logic before attaching a websocket this time as I have plans to expand the game further.

TODOS
Milestones 1: 
    - Create a refactored version of https://github.com/ShawnMorreau/no-shot-backend while following TDD as much as possible
